# Pixellary

Pixellary is a web-based gallery application that allows users to upload and display images using Firebase Storage and Firestore. Images uploaded by users are dynamically displayed in a gallery, with metadata like the image name and URL stored in Firestore. The app uses lazy loading to enhance performance by only loading images as they come into view.

Key features include a real-time progress bar during uploads, the ability to preview images before uploading, and a modal view for enlarging images when clicked. This project is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and integrates Firebase for storage and database functionalities.
